# CC0TextureDownloader

Simple script to batch download CC0 textures from ambientcg.com.
It is possible to filter what you download based on "download attributes" (resolution, filetype, etc), file extensions, and a keyword.

This script doesnt properly utilise the ambientCG API, ill probably make a new script that does.
