# CC0TextureDownloader

Simple script to batch download CC0 textures from ambientcg.com.
It is possible to filter what you download based on "download attributes" (resolution, filetype, etc), file extensions, and a keyword.

Still lots of stuff to implement in this to make it quicker and easier to use.
